## Experimental Setup

These data sets were recorded from healthy subjects. In the whole session motor imagery was performed without feedback. For each subject two classes of motor imagery were selected from the three classes left hand, right hand, and foot (side chosen by the subject; optionally also both feet).
 
### Calibration data

In the first two runs, arrows pointing left, right, or down were presented as visual cues on a computer screen. Cues were displayed for a period of 4s during which the subject was instructed to perform the cued motor imagery task. These periods were interleaved with 2s of blank screen and 2s with a fixation cross shown in the center of the screen. The fixation cross was superimposed on the cues, i.e. it was shown for 6s. These data sets are provided with complete marker information. 

### Technical Information

The recording was made using BrainAmp MR plus amplifiers and a Ag/AgCl electrode cap. Signals from 59 EEG positions were measured that were most densely distributed over sensorimotor areas. Signals were band-pass filtered between 0.05 and 200 Hz and then digitized at 1000 Hz with 16 bit (0.1 uV) accuracy. We provide also a version of the data that is downsampled at 100 Hz (first low-pass filtering the original data (Chebyshev Type II filter of order 10 with stopband ripple 50dB down and stopband edge frequency 49Hz) and then calculating the mean of blocks of 10 samples).
